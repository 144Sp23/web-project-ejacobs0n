        <h1>The Beginning</h1>

        <p>Team Cognito was created by the 8 original members. It was initially just suppose to be a "gaming group" online within friends. Each from their own place around the United States. After some time went by the group decided to get more serious with the conversation of becoming an actual, funded and established organization. Thus, starting Team Cognito Esports. </p>

        <p>These are the original founders of Team Cognito and their story.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>skrt (lunarr)</dt>
          <dd>Skrt began his gaming journey under the alias of "lunarr". "I just wanted something that respresented the moon or something from space, I don't know why, it just sounded cool". He began his gaming days playing different games on his dad's Playstation 2, eventually switching to COD4 Modern Warfare on his dad's iMac. From their skrt got his own xbox 360, going by a number of alias in the next couple of years he played: COD: Black Ops, Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3, and Black Ops 4. While also sprinkling in games such as Minecraft or some sort of horror game. Eventually buying his own PC he got into fortnite and then decided to create Cognito. "The rest is history," he said.</dd>

          <dt>Sebozy</dt>
          <dd>Seb or "Sebozy" started out on Fortnite in 2017 on his brothers Playstation 4. Playing with friends from school and town until he was "just too good" for them. He wanted to explore his options, but little did he know skrt's roommate in college at the time would be best friends with Sebozy and introduce the 2. Shorting after they didn't talk much until Seb got a PC, to which they both started their own PC jounreys playing Fortnite tounreys and making content together. </dd>
